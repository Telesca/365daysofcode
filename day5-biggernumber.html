# Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript.

var first_number = Number(prompt("Pick a number", ""));
	second_number = Number(prompt("Pick a number", ""));
	
if first_number > second_number
		alert("The bigger number is " + first_number.);
	
	if second_number > first_number
		alert("The bigger number is " + second_number.);
