// You are now declaring an array.
// Arrays are an awesome data structure!
var junk = ["file", "glare", 24, 7];
console.log(junk);

// Array practice. (Array made by Codecademy. I am allergic to peanuts.)

var junkData = ["Eddie Murphy", 49, "peanuts", 31];
console.log(junkData[3])

//Arrays and literature

var books = ["Moby Dick", "Ulysses", "The Jungle", "Death Comes for the Arch Bishop"];

for (var i = 0; i < books.length; i++) {
    console.log("I would like to read " + books[i]);
}
